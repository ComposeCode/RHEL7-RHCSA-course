# Chapter 2, Section 2: SSH (Secure Shell)

RHEL Systems can be accessed in multiple ways, the most common way is through the use of secure shell. Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol which can be used to work remotely on Linux and other Unix systems. SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network through a client-server architecture.

Most distributions of Windows do not come with an SSH client, so a free tool like PuTTY must be downloaded. This may not be true for newer versions of Windows (such as Windows 10). Most Unix systems including RHEL and OSX machines will come with an SSH client which can usually be accessed through the terminal.
